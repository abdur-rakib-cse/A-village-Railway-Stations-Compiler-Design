**Md Abdur Rakib's Lab Final Project: "ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE OF TRAIN" Description**

---

### Overview:

The project "ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE OF TRAIN" developed by Md Abdur Rakib is a graphical simulation built using OpenGL. It visualizes the operations and environment of a train station, including the arrival and departure of a train, the transition between day and night, and the control of signal lights. The user interface is designed for simplicity, utilizing both keyboard and mouse inputs.

### Features:

1. **Signal Light Control**: 
    - Users can change the signal light of the train station.
    - Pressing 'r' or 'R' will set the signal light to red, indicating the train to stop or hold its position.
    - Pressing 'g' or 'G' will set the signal light to green, signaling the train to proceed.

2. **Time Transition**:
    - The project allows users to switch between day and night scenarios to visualize the train station's appearance during different times.
    - Press 'd' or 'D' to change the scene to daytime, brightening the visuals.
    - Press 'n' or 'N' to shift to nighttime, creating a dimmed atmosphere.

3. **Train Operation**:
    - Users can control the train's movement.
    - By pressing 't' or 'T', the train is simulated to arrive at the station, allowing users to observe its dynamics and interactions.

4. **Interactive Mouse Controls**:
    - A menu can be accessed by pressing the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON. This menu might provide additional functionalities or settings for users to explore.
    - Pressing the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON will quit the program, ensuring easy and straightforward termination.

### Technical Implementation:

The project is designed using OpenGL, a cross-platform application programming interface (API) used for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. Through this API, the user can experience smooth graphics transitions and interactions. The combination of keyboard and mouse controls provides an immersive experience, allowing the user to manipulate multiple aspects of the simulation.

### Conclusion:

Md Abdur Rakib's final lab project offers an interactive experience of a train station's operations and environment. It showcases the potential of OpenGL for creating realistic and responsive simulations. This project serves as a commendable demonstration of the application of graphics programming in recreating real-world scenarios.
